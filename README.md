A basic SpecFlow test that checks that a User can both successfully Login to a given website and that in the case of incorrect 
login information being entered, the correct warnings are displayed utilising a SpecFlow Scenario for 7 different test scenarios.

Ordinarily in the real world, an API would be used to setup User Logins, the purpose of this test is to demonstrate how a 
SpecFlow Scenario Outline cycles through test cases.
